This was my first HF radio, and I made lots of great contacts on it before I upgraded to an [Icom IC7300.](https://www.icomamerica.com/en/products/amateur/hf/7300/default.aspx)

Some quick details on modifications I made to this radio:

 - IF Tap to use an external SDR as a panadapter
 - Switched RX port, shares antenna with a wide bandwidth SDR, grounds on TX
 - DSP S-Meter/Spectrum Scope
 - KD8CEC Firmware
 - 3.2" Nextion Touch SCreen
 - P-Channel MOSFET reverse polarity protection & fused power input
 - Built in USB Soundcard
 - External tuner control for my LDG antenna tuner. 

 Enjoy!
