I'm currently employed as a CAD/IT Technician at CRESA 911 in Vancouver, Washington. Previously I was a Hardware Maintenance Technician at Evergreen Public Schools. In my spare time I'm a computer hobbiest/home-labber, amateur radio operator (callisgn: AG7SU) and father of two. 

### About this site
This site is intended as both a personal blog and a 'Portfolio' of my projects, past and ongoing. 

This page is self hosted on a VPS using NGINX, it is a static site generated by a python program called pelican that lets me write all the posts in markdown, it uses a version of a theme called blue penguin that I modified for use here. 


Thanks for visiting!
